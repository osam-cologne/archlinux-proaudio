# archlinux-proaudio AUR mirrors
For packages listed in the `packages` file we automatically
[maintain an AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?SeB=M&K=osamc) that is updated whenever a change
is pushed to `master`, provided the package built was successful.

Only add packages to the list if the package doesn't exist yet in the AUR (excluding VCS packages).
If it exists and you are the maintainer, you may add it and make [osamc](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/osamc)
a co-maintainer. _All maintainers should be aware that updates happen automatically and the AUR package is
considered a mirror!_
